# Python Warm Up

This Python Warm-Up has three goals:

1. Get you up to speed with the basics of writing and running Python code using the VS Code text editor
2. Introduce you to unit testing Python files with Gradescope
3. Teach you some basic Python, assuming that you will have learned similar topics in the past with a different programming language 


## [Warm-Up 0: Sign up for Gradescope]()

   - Finding the length of a string: `len()`
   - String indexing with positive and negative indices: `[]`


## [Warm-Up 2: Hello Unit Testing (w/ Gradescope)](README_2.md)
- Submitting Python files to Gradescope

## Notes
   - Students will be reintroduced to all of the above topics in successive activities. 
   - All CS2/CS3 students should find these activities relatively easy. If not, we should reconsider course placement.
