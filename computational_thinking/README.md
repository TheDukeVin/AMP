# Computational Thinking

This unit has three goals:
- use a graphics-first approach using a text-based coding language to introduce:
    - variables
    - arithmetic
    - programmer-defined functions
    - repetition
    - selection
- introduce larger ideas in Computational Thinking:
    - Decomposition
    - Abstraction
    - Patterns
    - Algorithms
- provide a transferable foundation in Python syntax and control structures

Students will see the same topics again in the next unit, but without the immediate spatial feedback of graphical shapes. 
 
## [CT Warm-Up](README_0.md) (pre-Activity)
Part I:
- Use Microsoft Paint to draw a solution to your favorite tangram puzzle. 
- Decomposition
- Abstraction
- Pattern Recognition
- Algorithms
- fill color vs stroke color
- lines as a graphical operation

Part II:
- Running tangram.py in VS Code
- Making small changes to tangram.py
- Introducing common errors in tangram.py
    - Indentation
    - Misspelling library function
    - Missing parameter

## [CT Activity 1: Tangrams](README_1.md)
- Basic Python instructions and syntax
    - indentation
    - library functions

## [CT Activity 2: Curve Stitching](README_2.md)
- Recreate several curve stitching examples
- functions
- variables
- for loops
- RGB color

## [CT Activity 3: Throwing Darts](README_3.md)
- Approximating pi with a randomized experiment
- built-in functions
- expected value vs actual value
- matplotlib
- chance to practice more with graphics
